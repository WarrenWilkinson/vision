#+Title: TACTICS

 - Port Moody solicits input on their budget every year. If we have good ideas, we can bring them forward.
 - Increasing the number of businesses would raise tax rates (but individual business success has no impact -- it's a poll tax).
   - Ideas that could plausibly do so would probably go over well.
 - Is there a way to switch from a poll tax to a means tested tax?  Not all houses and areas recieve same level of service / quality of life.
