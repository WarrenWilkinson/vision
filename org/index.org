This stuff represents the notes of a sort of "Environmental Thinktank"
of one person.  Warren Wilkinson.

I'm currently working on a [[file:problem_product.org][Problem Report]], which will combine ideas in [[file:publishing.org][publishing]] with
the raw data I've explored as part of [[file:problem.org][the problem]].

 - I have this page on [[file:coquitlam.org][Coquitlam]], and [[file:budgets.org][budgets]], and this page 
 - Also a few notes on [[file:urbanfood.org][Urban Food]], and [[file:tactics.org][tactics]].
 - A brief word on [[file:requirements.org][what we're trying to do]].
 - A note on [[file:pace.org][PACE]]. Some [[file:misc.org][Misc ideas]] I haven't evaluated yet.
