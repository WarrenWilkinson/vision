#+TITLE: Misc Ideas

This is a bunch of ideas whos goodness I have not evaluated.

- Regional Bike-based transport.
- Regional online marketplace, with free shipping in Coquitlam using above Bike-based transport. (So local businesses can compete with Amazon, a company which, I think does not pay any taxes).
- Unify all tri-city libraries.
- Free 'ship to libraries' for our online marketplace.
- More requirements on infill houses... perhaps not monster houses unless they are built to become duplexes in the future.
- Cities sometimes have savings. Requirement for that to be invested in local businesses.
- City sized, mandatory, food buyers club for staples and local farming.
- Bus stations, More busses, covered stations, free transit
